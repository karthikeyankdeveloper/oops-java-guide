This repository offers a thorough guide to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles using **Java**. It covers fundamental and advanced OOP concepts with practical examples and code snippets to enhance understanding and application of Javaâ€™s object-oriented features.

Key topics include:

-   **Classes and Objects**: Definitions, creation, and manipulation of classes and objects.
-   **Inheritance**: Understanding and implementing inheritance to create hierarchical class structures.
-   **Polymorphism**: Utilizing method overriding and interfaces to achieve polymorphic behavior.
-   **Encapsulation**: Implementing access control and data hiding to safeguard object integrity.
-   **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and methods for creating generalized class structures.
-   **Design Patterns**: Common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer in Java.

Ideal for Java developers seeking to solidify their understanding of OOP principles and improve their coding practices through object-oriented design. The repository includes detailed explanations and examples to facilitate learning and application of these core concepts.
